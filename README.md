# Digital-Clock_8051
Hey this is a code for one of the projects I made using the 8051 microcontroller and certain ICs.
The code is to display the minutes and seconds in a digital clock using the 7 segment displays, 2:4 BCD decoder.
You can implement the code in Proteus software and upload the .hex file in the microcontroller.
